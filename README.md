## Book Library System Project:

### Overview:

A Book Library System is a command-line application designed to manage a collection of books in a library. It allows librarians or users to perform various operations related to book management, such as adding new books, viewing existing books, searching for books, borrowing and returning books, and more.

## Features:

1. **User Authentication:** Optionally, implement user authentication to ensure that only authorized users (e.g., librarians, registered users) can access certain functionalities.

2. **Book Management Functions:**

   - **Add New Books:** Allow users to add new books to the library by providing book details such as title, author, genre, publication year, etc.
   - **View Books:** Display the list of all books available in the library, along with their details such as title, author, availability status, etc.
   - **Search Books:** Implement search functionality to allow users to search for books by various criteria such as title, author, genre, publication year, etc.
   - **Borrowing and Returning Books:** Enable users to borrow books from the library and return them when they are done. Keep track of the borrowing history and availability status of each book.

3. **User Management Functions:**

   - **Register New Users:** Allow new users to register an account with the library system.
   - **View User Details:** Provide functionality for users to view their account details, including borrowed books.

4. **Data Persistence:**

   - **Database Integration:** Integrate a database (SQLite) to store book data, user information, borrowing history, etc.

5. **Error Handling:**

   - **Input Validation:** Implement input validation to handle invalid inputs and prevent data corruption or security vulnerabilities.
   - **Exception Handling:** Use exception handling to gracefully handle errors and exceptions that may occur during program execution.

6. **User Interface:**
   - **CLI Interface:** Design a user-friendly command-line interface with clear menus, prompts, and options for users to navigate and interact with the system efficiently.
